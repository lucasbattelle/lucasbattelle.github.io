I think most, if not every, runner will agree that running significantly effects your mood. Before I began running I aws aware of that running and other exercises can help to lift moods, but I did not realize that the opposite could also be true.

I've been training running off and on for a couple years now, and a patter has begun to emerge. I begin by setting a goal, for example, running a marathon. What follows is an immediate burst of motivation. I start of consisten with my training, running 3-5 days a week and increasing milage each week. After every run, I'm satisfied and happy. 

Unfortunately, it's impossible for me to keep this up forever. Eventually something gets in the way. A nagging injury appears, life gets in the way and I get thrown off my routine, I start a different hobby and don't have the energy. What happens is, I start to slide. The routine of good exercise and no longer there, my life becomes unorganized and chaotic.

What usually happens from here, is a short period of limbo. I still run, but not as regularly, with less enjoyment, and for shorter distances. Often my healthy diet will go at the same time. After a couple weeks I'll snap out of it. Realize what has happend and try to climb to my previous level of routine. Sometimes it happens, sometimes not.

What I'm trying to get at here, is often I will rely on running to give me routine within my life. But, unfortunately, the consistency with which I'm able to run is slightly out of my contro. And so by building my routine on top of something I can not control, I build a routine which can be easily broken.

In the future, I'll look for something else to build my routine off of. Right now though, I'm running a lot and I think this time, nothing will stop me!
